# SpiRIT_TPC_DataAna
This repository will be used to orgnize some macroscripts or classes that I always used in the sTPC data analysis.
These script is only temporary codes and don't have general functions, so I won't merge these into SpiRITROOT before these codes 
don't grow up to a useful and general code.
